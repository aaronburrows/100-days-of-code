# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on touching up some CSS on my personal site.

**Thoughts** I really need to spend more time on this site. A lot of it is a design process, but part of good design is good code. I'll have more to show for it in the coming days.
