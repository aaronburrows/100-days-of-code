# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on touching up some CSS on my personal site.

**Thoughts** I really need to spend more time on this site. A lot of it is a design process, but part of good design is good code. I'll have more to show for it in the coming days.

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More CSS and refactoring some HTML on the personal site.

**Thoughts** I know it's boring right now. I realize that I don't have a good working environment for myself (While my workflow at my full time job is fine, I want to get myself in a better position for personal projects, and I want something that's portable.)

### Day 3: January 7, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: You'll notice I skipped a couple days. I just want to be honest about putting in 100 total days. TOday I worked on setting up Nginx on my local dev machine and read about using it as a reverse proxy for Node.js apps.

**Thoughts** I really want to get good at the webserver stack (I'm pretty familiar with the standard LAMP setup, but there's so much more cool stuff now.) From what I see I really like Nginx. It seems far lighter and simpler to configure than Apache, which is a monster. Not a bad thing, just huge. I'm mostly serving static sites, and will experiment with some apps. Want to replace my CMS with something nice and modern too. I like WordPress, but there's a ton of stuff about it I hate. Current site is static HTML/PHP files, and I feel like I can do better than that, but without so much overhead. So right now establishing a good workflow and setting myself up with proper tools is the priority.
